This is a repo containing all my univesity projects using ANSYS Mechanical Software.
Projects 1 to 5 were scripted using ANSYS Parametric Design Language (APDL)
Project 6 is the same as 5, however created entirely using ANSYS Workbench.

These Projects contain:
1: -Scripting a simple geometry, finite elements, defining boundary conditions such as loads or number of degree of freedoms, solving the case and displaying results.

2: -More or less as above with use of parameters, this was used in class for further optimization of mechanical design.

3: -Solving again the same case with use of shell modelling for non-linear analysis and calculating loss of stability.

4: -This project shows step by step loads on a single-axis symmetric disc spring during the production process, so stresses while shaping, deformation after production process
    and in working conditions.

5: -Contact stress analysis between a shaft and a sleeve the shaft has been pressed into with given tolerance.

6: -As above, using workbench.

Most of the above where tested on ANSYS 2021 R2 on Student License, so they should work on any license.
Please treat this repo more as a portfolio than actual code, however all of it works perfectly fine.
